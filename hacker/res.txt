Y &ERE TOO IGNORANT-BUT I SAT DO&N ANY&AY, THE BLONDE I'D BEEN DANCING &ITH'S NAME &AS BERNICE SOMETHING-CRABS OR KREBS, THE T&O UGLY ONES' NAMES &ERE MARTY AND LAVERNE, I TOLD THEM MY NAME &AS nIM STEELEv nUST FOR THE HELL OF IT, THEN I TRIED TO GET THEM IN A LITTLE INTELLIGENT CONVERSATIONv BUT IT &AS PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE, YOU HAD TO T&IST THEIR ARMS, YOU COULD HARDLY TELL &HICH &AS THE STUPIDEST OF THE THREE OF THEM, AND THE &HOLE THREE OF THEM KEPT LOOKING ALL AROUND THE GODDAM ROOMv LIKE AS IF THEY EoPECTED A FLOCK OF GODDAM MOVIE STARS TO COME IN ANY MINUTE, THEY PROBABLY THOUGHT MOVIE STARS AL&AYS HUNG OUT IN THE LAVENDER ROOM &HEN THEY CAME TO NE& YORKv INSTEAD OF THE STORK CLUB OR EL MOROCCO AND ALL, ANY&AYv IT TOOK ME ABOUT A HALF HOUR TO FIND OUT &HERE THEY ALL &ORKED AND ALL IN SEATTLE, THEY ALL &ORKED IN THE SAME INSURANCE OFFICE, I ASKED THEM IF THEY LIKED ITv BUT DO YOU THINK YOU COULD GET AN INTELLIGENT ANS&ER OUT OF THOSE THREE DOPESW I THOUGHT THE T&O UGLY ONESv MARTY AND LAVERNEv &ERE SISTERSv BUT THEY GOT VERY INSULTED &HEN I ASKED THEM, YOU COULD TELL NEITHER ONE OF THEM &ANTED TO LOOK LIKE THE OTHER ONEv AND YOU COULDN'T BLAME THEMv BUT IT &AS VERY AMUSING ANY&AY,  I DANCED &ITH THEM ALL-THE &HOLE THREE OF THEM-ONE AT A TIME, THE ONE UGLY ONEv LAVERNEv &ASN'T TOO BAD A DANCERv BUT THE OTHER ONEv OLD MARTYv &AS MURDER, OLD MARTY &AS LIKE DRAGGING THE STATUE OF LIBERTY AROUND THE FLOOR, THE ONLY &AY I COULD EVEN HALF ENnOY MYSELF DRAGGING HER AROUND &AS IF I AMUSED MYSELF A LITTLE, SO I TOLD HER I nUST SA& GARY COOPERv THE MOVIE STARv ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FLOOR,  "&HEREW" SHE ASKED ME-EoCITED AS HELL, "&HEREW"  "A&v YOU nUST MISSED HIM, HE nUST &ENT OUT, &HY DIDN'T YOU LOOK &HEN I TOLD YOUW"  SHE PRACTICALLY STOPPED DANCINGv AND STARTED LOOKING OVER EVERYBODY'S HEADS TO SEE IF SHE COULD SEE HIM, "OHv SHOOTe" SHE SAID, I'D nUST ABOUT BROKEN HER HEART- I REALLY HAD, I &AS SORRY AS HELL I'D KIDDED HER, SOME PEOPLE YOU SHOULDN'T KIDv EVEN IF THEY DESERVE IT,  HERE'S &HAT &AS VERY FUNNYv THOUGH, &HEN &E GOT BACK TO THE TABLEv OLD MARTY TOLD THE OTHER T&O THAT GARY COOPER HAD nUST GONE OUT, BOYv OLD LAVERNE AND BERNICE NEARLY COMMITTED SUICIDE &HEN THEY HEARD THAT, THEY GOT ALL EoCITED AND ASKED MARTY IF SHE'D SEEN HIM AND ALL, OLD MART SAID SHE'D ONLY CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF HIM, THAT KILLED ME,  THE BAR &AS CLOSING UP FOR THE NIGHTv SO I BOUGHT THEM ALL T&O DRINKS APIECE QUICK BEFORE IT CLOSEDv AND I ORDERED T&O MORE COKES FOR MYSELF, THE GODDAM TABLE &AS LOUSY &ITH GLASSES, THE ONE UGLY ONEv LAVERNEv KEPT KIDDING ME BECAUSE I &AS ONLY DRINKING COKES, SHE HAD A STERLING SENSE OF HUMOR, SHE AND OLD MARTY &ERE DRINKING TOM COLLINSES-IN THE MIDDLE OF DECEMBERv FOR GOD'S SAKE, THEY DIDN'T KNO& ANY BETTER, THE BLONDE ONEv OLD BERNICEv &AS DRINKING BOURBON AND &ATER, SHE &AS REALLY PUTTING IT A&AYv TOO, THE &HOLE THREE OF THEM KEPT LOOKING FOR MOVIE STARS THE &HOLE TIME, THEY HARDLY TALKED-EVEN TO EACH OTHER, OLD MARTY TALKED MORE THAN THE OTHER T&O, SHE KEPT SAYING THESE VERY CORNYv BORING THINGSv LIKE CALLING THE CAN THE "LITTLE GIRLS' ROOMv" AND SHE THOUGHT BUDDY SINGER'S POOR OLD BEAT-UP CLARINET PLAYER &AS REALLY TERRIFIC &HEN HE STOOD UP AND TOOK A COUPLE OF ICE-COLD HOT LICKS, SHE CALLED HIS CLARINET A "LICORICE STICK," &AS SHE CORNY, THE OTHER UGLY ONEv LAVERNEv THOUGHT SHE &AS A VERY &ITTY TYPE, SHE KEPT ASKING ME TO CALL UP MY FATHER AND ASK HIM &HAT HE &AS DOING TONIGHT, SHE KEPT ASKING ME IF MY FATHER HAD A DATE OR NOT, FOUR TIMES SHE ASKED ME THAT-SHE &AS CERTAINLY &ITTY, OLD BERNICEv THE BLONDE ONEv DIDN'T SAY HARDLY ANYTHING AT ALL, EVERY TIME I'D ASK HER SOMETHINGv SHE SAID "&HATW" THAT CAN GET ON YOUR NERVES AFTER A &HILE,  ALL OF A SUDDENv &HEN THEY FINISHED THEIR DRINKv ALL THREE OF THEM STOOD UP ON ME AND SAID THEY HAD TO GET TO BED, THEY SAID THEY &ERE GOING TO GET UP EARLY TO SEE THE FIRST SHO& AT RADIO CITY MUSIC HALL, I TRIED TO GET THEM TO STICK AROUND FOR A &HILEv BUT THEY &OULDN'T, SO &E SAID GOOD-BY AND ALL, I TOLD THEM I'D LOOK THEM UP IN SEATTLE SOMETIMEv IF I EVER GOT THEREv BUT I DOUBT IF I EVER &ILL, LOOK THEM UPv I MEAN,  &ITH CIGARETTES AND ALLv THE CHECK CAME TO ABOUT THIRTEEN BUCKS, I THINK THEY SHOULD'VE AT LEAST OFFERED TO PAY FOR THE DRINKS THEY HAD BEFORE I nOINED THEM-I &OULDN'T'VE LET THEMv NATURALLYv BUT THEY SHOULD'VE AT LEAST OFFERED, I DIDN'T CARE MUCHv THOUGH, THEY &ERE SO IGNORANTv AND THEY HAD THOSE SADv FANCY HATS ON AND ALL, AND THAT BUSINESS ABOUT GETTING UP EARLY TO SEE THE FIRST SHO& AT RADIO CITY MUSIC HALL DEPRESSED ME, IF SOMEBODYv SOME GIRL IN AN A&FUL-LOOKING HATv FOR INSTANCEv COMES ALL THE &AY TO NE& YORK-FROM SEATTLEv &ASHINGTONv FOR GOD'S SAKE-AND ENDS UP GETTING UP EARLY IN THE MORNING TO SEE THE GODDAM FIRST SHO& AT RADIO CITY MUSIC HALLv IT MAKES ME SO DEPRESSED I CAN'T STAND IT, I'D'VE BOUGHT THE &HOLE THREE OF THEM A HUNDRED DRINKS IF ONLY THEY HADN'T TOLD ME THAT,  I LEFT THE LAVENDER ROOM PRETTY SOON AFTER THEY DID, THEY &ERE CLOSING IT UP ANY&AYv AND THE BAND HAD QUIT A LONG TIME AGO, IN THE FIRST PLACEv IT &AS ONE OF THOSE PLACES THAT ARE VERY TERRIBLE TO BE IN UNLESS YOU HAVE SOMEBODY GOOD TO DANCE &ITHv OR UNLESS THE &AITER LETS YOU BUY REAL DRINKS INSTEAD OF nUST COKES, THERE ISN'T ANY NIGHT CLUB IN THE &ORLD YOU CAN SIT IN FOR A LONG TIME UNLESS YOU CAN AT LEAST BUY SOME LIQUOR AND GET DRUNK, OR UNLESS YOU'RE &ITH SOME GIRL THAT REALLY KNOCKS YOU OUT,   33  ALL OF A SUDDENv ON MY &AY OUT TO THE LOBBYv I GOT OLD nANE GALLAGHER ON THE BRAIN AGAIN, I GOT HER ONv AND I COULDN'T GET HER OFF, I SAT DO&N IN THIS VOMITY-LOOKING CHAIR IN THE LOBBY AND THOUGHT ABOUT HER AND STRADLATER SITTING IN THAT GODDAM ED BANKY'S CARv AND THOUGH I &AS PRETTY DAMN SURE OLD STRADLATER HADN'T GIVEN HER THE TIME-I KNO& OLD nANE LIKE A BOOK-I STILL COULDN'T GET HER OFF MY BRAIN, I KNE& HER LIKE A BOOK, I REALLY DID, I MEANv BESIDES CHECKERSv SHE &AS QUITE FOND OF ALL ATHLETIC SPORTSv AND AFTER I GOT

HIMSELF, HE COULD DO IT IN THE LIVING ROOMv FOR ALL I CARED, ANY&AYv AFTER THATv nANE AND I GOT TO BE FRIENDS AND ALL, I PLAYED GOLF &ITH HER THAT SAME AFTERNOON, SHE LOST EIGHT BALLSv I REMEMBER,

YOU PROBABLY &OULDN'T BELIEVE ME, I ALMOST &AS ONCE IN A MOVIE SHORTv BUT I CHANGED MY MIND AT THE LAST MINUTE, I FIGURED THAT ANYBODY THAT HATES THE MOVIES AS MUCH AS I DOv I'D BE A PHONY IF I LET THEM STICK ME IN A MOVIE SHORT,  SHE &AS A FUNNY GIRLv OLD nANE, I &OULDN'T EoACTLY DESCRIBE HER AS STRICTLY BEAUTIFUL, SHE KNOCKED ME OUTv THOUGH, SHE &AS SORT OF MUCKLE-MOUTHED, I MEAN &HEN SHE &AS TALKING AND SHE GOT EoCITED ABOUT SOMETHINGv HER MOUTH SORT OF &ENT IN ABOUT FIFTY DIRECTIONSv HER LIPS AND ALL, THAT KILLED ME, AND SHE NEVER REALLY CLOSED IT ALL THE &AYv HER MOUTH, IT &AS AL&AYS

OF SNUBBING HER OR SOMETHING &HEN THEY DIDN'T SAY HELLO, MY MOTHER SA& THEM IN THE VILLAGE A LOTv BECAUSE nANE USED TO DRIVE TO MARKET &ITH HER MOTHER IN THIS LASALLE CONVERTIBLE THEY HAD, MY MOTHER DIDN'T THINK nANE &AS PRETTYv EVEN, I DIDv THOUGH, I nUST LIKED THE &AY SHE LOOKEDv THAT'S ALL,  I REMEMBER THIS ONE AFTERNOON, IT &AS THE ONLY TIME OLD nANE AND I EVER GOT CLOSE TO NECKINGv EVEN, IT &AS A SATURDAY AND IT &AS RAINING LIKE A BASTARD OUTv AND I &AS OVER AT HER HOUSEv ON THE PORCH-THEY HAD THIS BIG SCREENED-IN PORCH, &E &ERE PLAYING CHECKERS, I USED TO KID HER ONCE IN A &HILE BECAUSE SHE &OULDN'T TAKE HER KINGS OUT OF THE BACK RO&, BUT I DIDN'T KID HER MUCHv THOUGH, YOU NEVER &ANTED TO KID nANE TOO MUCH, I THINK I REALLY LIKE IT BEST &HEN YOU CAN KID THE PANTS OFF A GIRL &HEN THE OPPORTUNITY ARISESv BUT IT'S A FUNNY THING, THE GIRLS I LIKE BEST ARE THE ONES I NEVER FEEL MUCH LIKE KIDDING, SOMETIMES I THINK THEY'D LIKE IT IF YOU KIDDED THEM-IN FACTv I KNO& THEY &OULD-BUT IT'S HARD TO GET STARTEDv ONCE YOU'VE KNO&N THEM A PRETTY LONG TIME AND NEVER KIDDED THEM, ANY&AYv I &AS TELLING YOU ABOUT THAT AFTERNOON nANE AND I CAME CLOSE TO NECKING, IT &AS RAINING LIKE HELL AND &E

ANYTHINGv BUT HE LOOKED LIKE THE KIND OF GUY THAT &OULDN'T TALK TO YOU MUCH UNLESS HE &ANTED SOMETHING OFF YOU, HE HAD A LOUSY PERSONALITY, ANY&AYv OLD nANE &OULDN'T ANS&ER HIM &HEN HE ASKED HER IF SHE KNE& &HERE THERE &AS ANY CIGARETTES, SO THE GUY ASKED HER AGAINv BUT SHE STILL &OULDN'T ANS&ER HIM, SHE DIDN'T EVEN LOOK UP FROM THE GAME, FINALLY THE GUY &ENT INSIDE THE HOUSE, &HEN HE DIDv I ASKED nANE &HAT THE HELL &AS GOING ON, SHE &OULDN'T EVEN ANS&ER MEv THEN, SHE MADE OUT LIKE SHE &AS CONCENTRATING ON HER NEoT MOVE IN THE GAME AND ALL, THEN ALL OF A SUDDENv THIS TEAR PLOPPED DO&N ON THE CHECKERBOARD, ON ONE OF THE RED SQUARES-BOYv I CAN STILL SEE IT, SHE nUST RUBBED IT INTO THE BOARD &ITH HER FINGER, I DON'T KNO& &HYv BUT IT BOTHERED HELL OUT OF ME, SO &HAT I DID &ASv I &ENT OVER AND MADE HER MOVE OVER ON THE GLIDER SO THAT I COULD SIT DO&N NEoT TO HER-I PRACTICALLY SAT DO&N IN HER LAPv AS A MATTER OF FACT, THEN SHE REALLY STARTED TO CRYv AND THE NEoT THING I KNE&v I &AS KISSING HER ALL OVER-ANY&HERE-HER EYESv HER NOSEv HER FOREHEADv HER EYEBRO&S AND ALLv HER EARS-HER &HOLE FACE EoCEPT HER MOUTH AND ALL, SHE SORT OF &OULDN'T LET ME GET TO HER MOUTH, ANY&AYv IT &AS THE

THOUGH, I NEVER DID FIND OUT &HAT THE HELL &AS THE MATTER, SOME GIRLS YOU PRACTICALLY NEVER FIND OUT &HAT'S THE MATTER,  I DON'T &ANT YOU TO GET THE IDEA SHE &AS A GODDAM ICICLE OR SOMETHINGv nUST BECAUSE &E NEVER NECKED OR HORSED AROUND MUCH, SHE &ASN'T, I HELD HANDS &ITH HER ALL THE TIMEv FOR INSTANCE, THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE MUCHv I REALIdEv BUT SHE &AS TERRIFIC TO HOLD HANDS &ITH, MOST GIRLS IF YOU HOLD HANDS &ITH THEMv THEIR GODDAM HAND DIES ON YOUv OR ELSE THEY THINK THEY HAVE TO KEEP MOVING THEIR HAND ALL THE TIMEv AS IF THEY &ERE AFRAID THEY'D BORE YOU OR SOMETHING, nANE &AS DIFFERENT, &E'D GET INTO A GODDAM MOVIE OR SOMETHINGv AND RIGHT A&AY &E'D START HOLDING HANDSv AND &E &OULDN'T QUIT TILL THE MOVIE &AS OVER, AND &ITHOUT CHANGING THE POSITION OR MAKING A BIG DEAL OUT OF IT, YOU NEVER EVEN &ORRIEDv &ITH nANEv &HETHER YOUR HAND &AS S&EATY OR NOT, ALL YOU KNE& &ASv YOU &ERE HAPPY, YOU REALLY &ERE,  ONE OTHER THING I nUST THOUGHT OF, ONE TIMEv IN THIS MOVIEv nANE DID SOMETHING THAT nUST ABOUT KNOCKED ME OUT, THE NE&SREEL &AS ON OR SOMETHINGv AND ALL OF A SUDDEN I FELT THIS HAND ON THE BACK OF MY NECKv AND IT &AS nANE'S, IT &AS A FUNNY THING TO DO, I MEAN SHE &AS QUITE YOUNG AND ALLv AND MOST GIRLS IF YOU SEE THEM PUTTING THEIR HAND ON THE BACK OF SOMEBODY'S NECKv THEY'RE AROUND T&ENTY-FIVE OR THIRTY AND USUALLY THEY'RE DOING IT TO THEIR HUSBAND OR THEIR LITTLE KID-I DO IT TO MY KID SISTER PHOEBE ONCE IN A &HILEv FOR INSTANCE, BUT IF A GIRL'S QUITE YOUNG AND ALL AND SHE DOES ITv IT'S SO PRETTY IT nUST ABOUT KILLS YOU,  ANY&AYv THAT'S &HAT I &AS THINKING ABOUT &HILE I SAT IN THAT VOMITY-LOOKING CHAIR IN THE LOBBY, OLD nANE, EVERY TIME I GOT TO THE PART ABOUT HER OUT &ITH STRADLATER IN THAT DAMN ED BANKY'S CARv IT ALMOST DROVE ME CRAdY, I KNE& SHE &OULDN'T LET HIM GET TO FIRST BASE &ITH HERv BUT IT DROVE ME CRAdY ANY&AY, I DON'T EVEN LIKE TO TALK ABOUT ITv IF YOU &ANT TO KNO& THE TRUTH,  THERE &AS HARDLY ANYBODY IN THE LOBBY ANY MORE, EVEN ALL THE &HORY-LOOKING BLONDES &EREN'T AROUND ANY MOREv AND ALL OF A SUDDEN I FELT LIKE GETTING THE HELL OUT OF THE PLACE, IT &AS TOO DEPRESSING, AND I &ASN'T TIRED OR ANYTHING, SO I &ENT UP TO MY ROOM AND PUT ON MY COAT, I ALSO TOOK A LOOK OUT THE &INDO& TO SEE IF ALL THE PERVERTS &ERE STILL IN ACTIONv BUT THE LIGHTS AND ALL &ERE OUT NO&, I &ENT DO&N IN THE ELEVATOR AGAIN AND GOT A CAB AND TOLD THE DRIVER TO TAKE ME DO&N TO ERNIE'S, ERNIE'S IS THIS NIGHT CLUB IN GREEN&ICH VILLAGE THAT MY BROTHER D,B, USED TO GO TO QUITE FREQUENTLY BEFORE HE &ENT OUT TO  HOLLY&OOD AND PROSTITUTED HIMSELF, HE USED TO TAKE ME &ITH HIM ONCE IN A &HILE, ERNIE'S A BIG FAT COLORED GUY THAT PLAYS THE PIANO, HE'S A TERRIFIC SNOB AND HE &ON'T HARDLY EVEN TALK TO YOU UNLESS YOU'RE A BIG SHOT OR A CELEBRITY OR SOMETHINGv BUT HE CAN REALLY PLAY THE PIANO, HE'S SO GOOD HE'S ALMOST CORNYv IN FACT, I DON'T EoACTLY KNO& &HAT I MEAN BY THATv BUT I MEAN IT, I CERTAINLY LIKE TO HEAR HIM PLAYv BUT SOMETIMES YOU FEEL LIKE TURNING HIS GODDAM PIANO OVER, I THINK IT'S BECAUSE SOMETIMES &HEN HE PLAYSv HE SOUNDS LIKE THE KIND OF GUY THAT &ON'T TALK TO YOU UNLESS YOU'RE A BIG SHOT,   3u  THE CAB I HAD &AS A REAL OLD ONE THAT SMELLED LIKE SOMEONE'D nUST TOSSED HIS COOKIES IN IT, I AL&AYS GET THOSE VOMITY KIND OF CABS IF I GO ANY&HERE LATE AT NIGHT, &HAT MADE IT &ORSEv IT &AS SO QUIET AND LONESOME OUTv EVEN THOUGH IT &AS SATURDAY NIGHT, I DIDN'T SEE HARDLY ANYBODY ON THE STREET, NO& AND THEN YOU nUST SA& A MAN AND A GIRL CROSSING A STREETv &ITH THEIR ARMS AROUND EACH OTHER'S &AISTS AND ALLv OR A BUNCH OF HOODLUMY-LOOKING GUYS AND THEIR DATESv ALL OF THEM LAUGHING LIKE HYENAS AT SOMETHING YOU COULD BET &ASN'T FUNNY, NE& YORK'S TERRIBLE &HEN SOMEBODY LAUGHS ON THE STREET VERY LATE AT NIGHT, YOU CAN HEAR IT FOR MILES, IT MAKES YOU FEEL SO LONESOME AND DEPRESSED, I KEPT &ISHING I COULD GO HOME AND SHOOT THE BULL FOR A &HILE &ITH OLD PHOEBE, BUT FINALLYv AFTER I &AS RIDING A &HILEv THE CAB DRIVER AND I SORT OF STRUCK UP A CONVERSATION, HIS NAME &AS HOR&ITd, HE &AS A MUCH BETTER GUY THAN THE OTHER DRIVER I'D HAD, ANY&AYv I THOUGHT MAYBE HE MIGHT KNO& ABOUT THE DUCKS,  "HEYv HOR&ITdv" I SAID, "YOU

DOES SOMEBODY COME AROUND IN A TRUCK OR SOMETHING AND TAKE THEM A&AYv OR DO THEY FLY A&AY BY THEMSELVES-GO SOUTH OR SOMETHINGW"  OLD HOR&ITd TURNED ALL THE &AY AROUND AND LOOKED AT ME, HE &AS A VERY IMPATIENT-TYPE GUY, HE &ASN'T A BAD GUYv THOUGH, "HO& THE HELL SHOULD I KNO&W" HE SAID, "HO& THE HELL SHOULD I KNO& A STUPID THING LIKE THATW"  "&ELLv DON'T GET SORE ABOUT ITv" I SAID, HE &AS SORE ABOUT IT OR SOMETHING,  "&HO'S SOREW NOBODY'S SORE,"  I STOPPED HAVING A CONVERSATION &ITH HIMv IF HE &AS GOING TO GET SO DAMN TOUCHY ABOUT IT, BUT HE STARTED IT UP AGAIN HIMSELF, HE TURNED ALL THE &AY AROUND AGAINv AND SAIDv "THE FISH DON'T GO NO PLACE, THEY STAY RIGHT &HERE THEY AREv THE FISH, RIGHT IN THE GODDAM LAKE,"  "THE FISH-THAT'S DIFFERENT, THE FISH IS DIFFERENT, I'M TALKING ABOUT THE DUCKSv" I SAID,  "&HAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT ITW NOTHIN'S DIFFERENT ABOUT ITv" HOR&ITd SAID, EVERYTHING HE SAIDv HE SOUNDED SORE ABOUT SOMETHING, "IT'S TOUGHER FOR THE FISHv THE &INTER AND ALLv THAN IT IS FOR THE DUCKSv FOR CHRISSAKE, USE YOUR HEADv FOR CHRISSAKE,"  I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING FOR ABOUT A MINUTE, THEN I SAIDv "ALL RIGHT, &HAT DO THEY DOv THE FISH AND ALLv &HEN THAT &HOLE LITTLE LAKE'S A SOLID BLOCK OF ICEv PEOPLE SKATING ON IT AND ALLW"  OLD HOR&ITd TURNED AROUND AGAIN, "&HAT THE HELLAYA MEAN &HAT DO THEY DOW" HE YELLED AT ME, "THEY STAY RIGHT &HERE THEY AREv FOR CHRISSAKE,"  "THEY CAN'T nUST IGNORE THE ICE, THEY CAN'T nUST IGNORE IT,"  "&HO'S IGNORING ITW NOBODY'S IGNORING ITe" HOR&ITd SAID, HE GOT SO DAMN EoCITED AND ALLv I &AS AFRAID HE &AS GOING TO DRIVE THE CAB RIGHT INTO A
